<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Faculty of Education at the University of Hong Kong in August 2025, under the supervision of Professor Chin-Hsi Lin and Professor Chun Lai. Previously, I earned my Master’s degree from the UCL Institute of Education. My research primarily focuses on technology-enhanced language education and higher education.

To date, I have published a total of 25 journal and conference papers. Among these, 11 are in JCR Q1 journals. Three of my papers were published in Computers & Education. One first-authored paper was selected as an ESI Highly Cited Paper.

I have presented ten papers at two leading international conferences in the field of education and educational technology — the AERA Annual Meeting and the AECT Annual Convention. One of my first-authored papers was featured in Scientific American, a prominent U.S. media outlet affiliated with Nature Publishing Group.
